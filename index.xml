  <title>Word Search Clock</title>
  <dc:creator>Aswin van Woudenberg</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.aswinvanwoudenberg.com/posts/word-search-clock/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ A few weeks ago, my clock stopped working, and I wasn’t inclined to invest in a replacement. After futile attempts to revive it, I decided to get crafty. I had an unused photo frame collecting dust and realized it could be turned into a clock by making it display images that show the time of the day. I’d need one image for every minute of the day and display each of them for 60 seconds before transitioning to the next one. ]]></description>

  <link>https://www.aswinvanwoudenberg.com/posts/thinking-inside-the-matchbox/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling machines to learn and make decisions through trial and error. Recent successes in RL, such as agents that <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/agent57-outperforming-the-human-atari-benchmark">play Atari games</a>, <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-safer-dialogue-agents">hold</a> <a href="https://openai.com/research/instruction-following">conversations</a>, <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/accelerating-fusion-science-through-learned-plasma-control">control nuclear fusion plasma</a> and <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor">discover new algorithms</a>, have demonstrated its potential for solving complex problems. However, the roots of RL can be traced back to an earlier era, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Michie">Donald Michie</a> and his creation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine">MENACE</a>, helped pave the way for machines that could learn. ]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[ The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">n-queens problem</a> is a puzzle that involves placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can threaten another queen if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. The objective is to find all possible ways to place n queens on the chessboard without any of them threatening each other. ]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[ Sorting algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science, but understanding how they work can be tricky. In this blog post, I’ll demonstrate an easy way to visualize their inner workings. By the end, you’ll not only be able to visualize sorting algorithms, but other list algorithms as well. Let’s dive in! ]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[ Earlier this year, I embarked on the famous pilgrimage <em>Camino de Santiago</em>, walking from my hometown Leeuwarden in the north of the Netherlands all the way to Santiago de Compostela. For three months, I lived out of a backpack and primarily engaged in wild-camping along the trail. Throughout my journey, I visited some of the most awe-inspiring places, met incredible people along the way, and created unforgettable memories that I will cherish forever. ]]></description>

  <title>Traversing a Decision Tree to Win at Guess Who?</title>
  <dc:creator>Aswin van Woudenberg</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.aswinvanwoudenberg.com/posts/traversing-a-decision-tree-to-win-at-guess-who/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ In the scikit-learn machine learning library, the <code>predict</code> method is used to make predictions on new data with a fitted model. This method expects the input data to have the same number of features as the data that the model was trained on. This makes sense for many models, but not necessarily for decision trees. Since decision trees look at one feature at a time, they may only need a subset of all features to make a prediction. ]]></description>
