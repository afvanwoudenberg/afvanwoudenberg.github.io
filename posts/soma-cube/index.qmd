# Soma cube

The [Soma cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube) is the brainchild of Danish mathematician, inventor, designer, writer and poet [Piet Hein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hein_(scientist)). The puzzle consists of seven pieces and the goal is to assemble these pieces into a 3x3x3 cube or other shapes.

Piet Hein came up with this puzzle during a lecture on quantum physics by [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg). Instead of paying attention to the renowned theoretical physicist, Piet prefered idling away his time by thinking up frivolous brainteasers. Such a waste, not to mention rude! What's even worse is that people seemed to actually enjoy his puzzle. This meant that Piet Hein's invention wasn't just a time-waster for him but for everyone who got hooked on it.

Initially, the Soma cube was mostly known in Scandinavian countries, but things took a dark turn when [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner) featured it in his [Mathematical Games column](https://bobson.ludost.net/copycrime/mgardner/gardner02.pdf#page=64) in Scientific American in September 1958. Suddenly, the whole world got introduced to this time-waster.

As a self-proclaimed restorer of productivity, I hate to see people trifle away their lives trying to solve these inane puzzles. For this reason I've created a Soma solver in Python so people can go back to spending time on more fruitful pursuits.

Read on to learn how I did this.

## The Soma puzzle pieces

Each of the seven pieces has a different shape. I've given each shape a different color to ease visualizing solutions later on.

![p](p.png)
![t](t.png)
![b](b.png)
![a](a.png)
![l](l.png)
![v](v.png)

As mentioned above, the objective is to assemble these pieces into various shapes, like a cube.

## Importing libraries

Let's start by importing some libraries. We'll use `matplotlib` to visualize solutions in 3D. 

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
import ipywidgets as widgets

from IPython.display import HTML
from math import ceil
```

## Representing the pieces

We'll represent each piece as a list of coordinates in 3D space. Each tuple is an (x, y, z) coordinate.

```{python}
z = [(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(2,1,0)] # blue piece
p = [(0,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,1,1),(1,1,0)] # red piece
t = [(0,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,0),(0,2,0)] # purple piece
b = [(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,1,1)] # brown piece
a = [(0,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0),(1,1,0)] # yellow piece
l = [(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(2,0,0),(0,1,0)] # orange piece
v = [(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(0,1,0)] # green piece
```

The letters `z`, `t`, `p`, `b`, `a`, `l`, and `v` look (with some imagination) like the pieces.

Let's put all pieces and colors in a list so we can access them by index.

```{python}
pieces = [z, p, t, b, a, l, v]
colors = ["blue", "red", "purple", "brown", "yellow", "orange", "green"]
```

## Visualizing the pieces and solution

Before writing the solver, let's consider how we can create a 3D visualization of the Soma cube. I've chosen to use Matplotlib for its 3D rendering capabilities.

Matplotlib can draw voxels (3D pixels) which we can use to visualize a single piece, multiple pieces, or even the full solution in 3D. The following function takes a 3D numpy array that represents the voxels and plots them.

```{python}
def plot_solution(colors, ax=None):
    if not ax:
        fig = plt.figure()

        # axis with 3D projection
        ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')
        
    ax.set_aspect('equal')
    ax.set_axis_off()

    # draw each voxel with a color (each voxel unequal to None)
    voxels = (colors != None)

    ax.voxels(voxels, facecolors=colors, edgecolors=colors)
```

To use this function we need to call it with a 3D numpy array that represents each voxel.

```{python}
voxels = np.empty((3,3,3), dtype='object')
```

Each element in this array is initialized to `None`.

```{python}
voxels
```

Let's set each element of `voxels` to a color and call `plot_solution`. We can set elements seperately, like this:

```{python}
voxels[0][0][0] = 'yellow'
voxels[1][0][0] = 'yellow'
voxels[0][0][1] = 'yellow'
voxels[0][1][1] = 'yellow'
```

Or we can set all elements at once.

```{python}
voxels = np.array([
    [['yellow', 'yellow', 'orange'],
     ['brown',  'yellow', 'orange'],
     ['brown',  'brown',  'orange']],
    [['yellow', 'green',  'orange'],
     ['brown',  'blue',   'blue'],
     ['blue',   'blue',   'red']],
    [['purple', 'green',  'green'],
     ['purple', 'purple', 'red'],
     ['purple', 'red',    'red']]
])
```

```{python}
plot_solution(voxels)
plt.show()
```

This is the same solution as shown above and one of the 240 possible unique ways of packing the seven Soma pieces into a 3x3x3 cube. 

Let's see how we can visualize a single piece.

```{python}
def plot_piece(piece, color, ax=None):
    max_dim = np.max([np.max(piece) + 1, 3])
    voxels = np.empty((max_dim, max_dim, max_dim), dtype='object')
    for x, y, z in piece:
        voxels[x][y][z] = color
    plot_solution(voxels, ax)
```

```{python}
plot_piece(z, "blue")
plt.show()
```

## Animating a solution

In the solution above it was impossible to tell how some pieces were positioned. The following function animates the assembly of a solution by adding pieces one by one.

```{python}
def animate_solution(colors):
    w, d, h = colors.shape
    
    show_order = []
    for a in range(1,max(w, d, h)+1):
        for z in range(min(a,h)):
            for x in range(min(a,w)):
                for y in range(d-1,d-1-min(a,d),-1):
                    color = colors[x][y][z]
                    if not (color is None or color in show_order):
                        show_order.append(color)
    
    fig = plt.figure()
    
    ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')
    
    def update(frame):
        ax.clear()
        ax.set_aspect('equal')
        ax.set_axis_off()
        
        voxels = np.in1d(colors, show_order[:frame+1]).reshape(colors.shape)

        ax.voxels(voxels, facecolors=colors, edgecolors=colors)

    plt.close()

    anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=len(show_order), interval=1000)
    
    return anim
```

```{python}
anim = animate_solution(voxels)
HTML(anim.to_jshtml(default_mode='once'))
```

Now it's much clearer how a solution is constructed.

## Rotating pieces

We will implement the solver using a simple recursive backtracking algorithm. The solver will try to fit the pieces in their various orientations. For this reason, we define some helper functions to rotate a piece around an axis. I also defined an `identity` function that just returns the input as is. Its use will become clear later.

```{python}
rotate_x = lambda cubelets: [(x, z, -y) for (x, y, z) in cubelets]
rotate_y = lambda cubelets: [(z, y, -x) for (x, y, z) in cubelets]
rotate_z = lambda cubelets: [(-y, x, z) for (x, y, z) in cubelets]
identity = lambda cubelets: cubelets
```

For instance, to rotate piece `z` around the x-axis we can make use of `rotate_x`.

```{python}
rotate_x(z)
```

We can see that rotating a piece may make some coordinates negative. The following function translates a piece so that all `x`, `y`, `z` coordinates are minimal but positive.

```{python}
def translate(piece):
    d_x, d_y, d_z = np.min(np.array(piece), axis=0) * -1
    return [(x + d_x, y + d_y, z + d_z) for (x, y, z) in piece]
```

Now we can do the same rotation as above but end up with coordinates that are all positive.

```{python}
translate(rotate_x(z))
```

We will use this `translate` function when we display individual pieces.

## Generating all orientations for each piece

Using the functions defined above we can generate all orientations for each piece. Several transformations are performed one after another. The `identity` function just returns the original orientation.

```{python}
def generate_rotations(piece):
    orientations = []
    for f_a in [identity, rotate_x,  rotate_y, rotate_z]:
        for f_b in [identity, rotate_x,  rotate_y, rotate_z]:
            for f_c in [identity, rotate_x,  rotate_y, rotate_z]:
                for f_d in [identity, rotate_x,  rotate_y, rotate_z]:
                    for f_e in [identity, rotate_x,  rotate_y, rotate_z]:
                        rot_piece = sorted(f_a(f_b(f_c(f_d(f_e(piece))))))
                        min_x, min_y, min_z = rot_piece[0]
                        trans_rot_piece = [(x - min_x, y - min_y, z - min_z) for x, y, z in rot_piece]
                        if trans_rot_piece not in orientations:
                            orientations.append(trans_rot_piece)
                        
    return orientations
```

We can call this function for one piece.

```{python}
generate_rotations(z)
```

Or we can apply this function to every piece in the `pieces` list we defined above.

```{python}
orientations = list(map(generate_rotations, pieces))
```

We can display all orientations for each piece. Note how we apply `translate` to make sure all coordinates end up in the positive quadrant.

```{python}
#| column: screen-inset
cols = 8
total_number_of_orientations = sum(list(map(len,orientations)))
rows = ceil(total_number_of_orientations / cols)
fig, axs = plt.subplots(rows, cols, figsize=(cols*3,rows*3), 
    subplot_kw= { 'projection':'3d' }, gridspec_kw = {'wspace':0.0, 'hspace':0.0})

fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.96)
fig.suptitle(f"Orientations", fontsize=16)

count = 0
for i in range(len(pieces)):
    for j in range(len(orientations[i])):
        plot_piece(translate(orientations[i][j]), colors[i], axs[count // cols, count % cols])
        count += 1

while count < cols * rows:
    axs[count // cols, count % cols].set_axis_off()
    count += 1

plt.show()
```

In the solver below, for each piece we'll see which orientation fits where.

## Writing the solver

We're finally ready to work on the solver for the Soma cube. The solver will take in a list of coordinates (that make up the cube that we want to fill up with pieces) and recursively search for a solution. 

We can generate this list of coordinates using a simple list comprehension.

```{python}
cube_coordinates = [(x, y, z) for x in range(3) for y in range(3) for z in range(3)]
```

```{python}
cube_coordinates
```

The solver will yield the same list but each tuple will have an extra element indicating the color that coordinate will get after all pieces have been placed.

We'll use a list of booleans to keep track of which pieces have been placed.

```{python}
pieces_used = [False] * 7
```

```{python}
def solve_soma_(solution, i):
    if i == 27:
        yield solution
    else:
        x, y, z, _ = solution[i]
        for piece in range(7):
            if not pieces_used[piece]:
                for orientation in orientations[piece]:
                    empty_coords = [(x + d_x, y + d_y, z + d_z, None) for (d_x, d_y, d_z) in orientation]
                    if all([tup in solution for tup in empty_coords]):
                        # placing piece: replace None with color
                        pieces_used[piece] = True
                        filled_coords = [(x + d_x, y + d_y, z + d_z, colors[piece]) for (d_x, d_y, d_z) in orientation]
                        new_solution = sorted([tup for tup in solution if tup not in empty_coords] + filled_coords)
                        
                        # find next empty coordinate
                        j = i
                        while j < 27 and new_solution[j][3]:
                            j += 1
                            
                        # continue search
                        yield from solve_soma_(new_solution, j)
                        pieces_used[piece] = False
```

```{python}
def solve_soma(coordinates):
    global pieces_used
    pieces_used = [False] * 7
    
    solution = sorted([(x, y, z, None) for x, y, z in coordinates])
    yield from solve_soma_(solution, 0)
```

You call the `solve_soma` function with a list of coordinates representing the space that will be packed with Soma pieces. The actual algorithm is implemented in `solve_soma_`. The algorithm does the following:

1. It checks if all coordinates are filled. If so, it yields the solution.
2. For each possible orientation of a piece, it checks if it can be placed from the current coordinate without overlapping with filled coordinates that are already in the solution.
3. If a valid placement is found, it recursively explores how to fill from the next empty coordinate.
4. After exploring a piece and its orientation, it tries other possibilities.

Different solutions may be duplicates of each other in the sense that one solution is a rotation of another.

## Finding and displaying a solution

The solver is a generator function that yields all solutions one by one. Let's start by just displaying the first solution it finds. 

The following function finds the first solution given a list of coordinates to fill and plots this solution.

```{python}
def solve_and_plot_first_solution(coordinates, ax=None):
    # instantiate generator
    gen = solve_soma(coordinates)

    # find first solution
    solution = next(gen)

    # find voxel space size
    max_dim = np.max(coordinates) + 1

    # fill 3D voxel array and plot it
    voxels = np.empty((max_dim, max_dim, max_dim), dtype='object')
    for x, y, z, color in solution:
        voxels[x][y][z] = color

    plot_solution(voxels, ax)
```

```{python}
solve_and_plot_first_solution(cube_coordinates)
plt.show()
```

We'll also define a function that finds the first solution and then animates it.

```{python}
def solve_and_animate_first_solution(coordinates):
    # instantiate generator
    gen = solve_soma(coordinates)

    # find first solution
    solution = next(gen)

    # find voxel space size
    max_dim = np.max(coordinates) + 1

    # fill 3D voxel array and plot it
    voxels = np.empty((max_dim, max_dim, max_dim), dtype='object')
    for x, y, z, color in solution:
        voxels[x][y][z] = color

    anim = animate_solution(voxels)
    display(HTML(anim.to_jshtml(default_mode='once')))
```

```{python}
solve_and_animate_first_solution(cube_coordinates)
```

## Creating other figures

We called the solver with `cube_coordinates` that contains the coordinates that make up a cube. Instead of a cube, we can also pass a sorted list of coordinates that make up another shape.

Let's look at some examples.

```{python}
pyramid_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, 0) for x in range(1, 4) for y in range(5)] + 
    [(x, y, 0) for x in [0, 4] for y in range(1, 4)] +

    [(1, 2, 1), (3, 2, 1), (2, 2, 2)]
)

turtle_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, z) for x in range(1, 4) for y in range(1, 4) for z in range(2)] +
    [(4, 2, z) for z in range(3)] + 
    [(0, 2, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 4, 0), (3, 0, 0), (3, 4, 0), (5, 2, 2)]
)

    [(x, y, 2) for x in range(1, 4) for y in range(3)]
)

tub_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, 0) for x in range(5) for y in range(3)] +
    [(x, y, 1) for x in range(5) for y in range(3) if x in [0, 4] or y in [0, 2]]
)

airplane_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, 0) for x in range(1, 6) for y in range(7) if x == 3 or y in [0, 1]] +
    [(x, y, 1) for x in range(7) for y in range(7) if y == 0 or (x == 3 and y != 5)]
)

bench_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, z) for x in range(5) for y in range(2) for z in range(3) if y == 1 or x in [0, 4]] +

    [(x, 1, 3) for x in range(1, 4)]
)

duck_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, z) for x in range(4) for y in range(3) for z in range(2)] +
    [(3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 3), (4, 1, 3)]
)

cascade_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, z) for x in range(3) for y in range(3) for z in range(5) if (2-x) + y >= z]
)

chair_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, z) for x in range(3) for y in range(3) for z in range(2)] +
    [(x, 2, z) for x in range(3) for z in range(2, 5)]
)

castle_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, 0) for x in range(5) for y in range(5) if (x, y) not in [(0,2), (4,2)]] +
    [(0, 0, 1), (0, 4, 1), (4, 0, 1), (4, 4, 1)]
)

dog_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, 0) for x in range(6) for y in range(3) if (x, y) not in [(3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 1)]] +
    [(x, y, 1) for x in range(5) for y in range(3) if x == 4 or y == 1] +
    [(x, 1, z) for x in range(3, 6) for z in range(2, 4) if (x, z) != (5, 3)]
)

cross_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, z) for x in range(3) for y in range(3) for z in range(2)] +
    [(1, y, 2) for y in range(3)] +
    [(1, 1, z) for z in range(3, 7)] + 
    [(0, 1, 5), (2, 1, 5)]
)

elephant_coordinates = sorted(
    [(0, 0, 0), (3, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), (3, 2, 0)] + 
    [(x, y, 1) for x in range(4) for y in range(3) if (x, y) != (3, 1)] +
    [(x, 1, z) for x in range(5) for z in range(2, 4) if (x, z) != (0, 3)] +
    [(4, 1, 1), (2, 0, 2), (2, 2, 2)]
)

stairs_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, z) for y in range(3) for z in range(3) for x in range(4-z)]
)

snake_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, z) for y in range(4) for z in range(2) for x in range(2*(3-y), (2*(3-y))+3)] +
    [(x, 0, z) for x in range(8, 10) for z in range(2, 4) if x == 8 or z == 3]
)

skyscraper_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, y, 0) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)] +
    [(x, y, z) for x in range(2) for y in range(1, 3) for z in range(1, 5)] + 
    [(1, 1, 5), (1, 1, 6)]
)

wall_coordinates = sorted(
    [(x, x - 1, 0) for x in range(1, 6)] +
    [(x, x, z) for x in range(6) for z in range(2)] +
    [(x, x + 1, z) for x in range(5) for z in range(2)]
)
```

Let's place these figures and their names into lists.

```{python}
figure_names = ["Cube", "Pyramid", "Turtle", "Tower", "Bear", "Tunnel", "Tub", "Airplane", 
                "Bench", "Duck", "Cascade", "Chair", "Castle", "Dog", "Cross", "Elephant",
                "Stairs", "Snake", "Skyscraper", "Wall"
               ]
figure_coordinates = [
    cube_coordinates, pyramid_coordinates, turtle_coordinates, 
    tower_coordinates, bear_coordinates, tunnel_coordinates,
    tub_coordinates, airplane_coordinates, bench_coordinates,
    duck_coordinates, cascade_coordinates, chair_coordinates,
    castle_coordinates, dog_coordinates, cross_coordinates,
    elephant_coordinates, stairs_coordinates, snake_coordinates,
    skyscraper_coordinates, wall_coordinates
]
```

You can add more figures if you want. Just make sure that each list contains exactly 27 coordinates. 

We can plot all figures as subplots.

```{python}
#| column: screen-inset-right
cols = 5
number_of_figures = len(figure_coordinates)
rows = ceil(number_of_figures / cols)
fig, axs = plt.subplots(rows, cols, figsize=(cols*3,rows*3), 
    subplot_kw= { 'projection':'3d' }, gridspec_kw = {'wspace':0.5, 'hspace':0.0})

fig.suptitle(f"Figures", fontsize=16)

count = 0
for i in range(number_of_figures):
    solve_and_plot_first_solution(figure_coordinates[i], axs[count // cols, count % cols])
    axs[count // cols, count % cols].set_title(figure_names[i])
    count += 1

while count < cols * rows:
    axs[count // cols, count % cols].set_axis_off()
    count += 1

plt.show()
```

I have to admit that some figures are pretty cute.

## Showing solutions one by one

Most figures can be assembled in more than one way. Using some widgets we can put together a simple GUI that lets us select a figure, solve it and iterate over the solutions.

We'll use a dropdown menu, a button, an output widget, and a label widget. The  solutions are shown as an animation we can step through.

```{.python}
figure_dropdown = widgets.Dropdown(options=zip(figure_names, figure_coordinates), value=cube_coordinates, description="Figure: ")
next_button = widgets.Button(description="Next")
hbox = widgets.HBox([figure_dropdown, next_button])
output = widgets.Output()
label = widgets.Label()

display(hbox, output, label)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
figure_dropdown = widgets.Dropdown(options=zip(figure_names, figure_coordinates), value=cube_coordinates, description="Figure: ")
next_button = widgets.Button(description="Next")
hbox = widgets.HBox([figure_dropdown, next_button])

display(hbox)
anim = animate_solution(voxels)
HTML(anim.to_jshtml(default_mode='once'))
```

To keep track of which solution to show next, we declare the following global variables:

```{.python}
gen = None
solution = None
```

The gen is a generator object that generates solutions for a given figure using the `solve_soma` function. The solution variable stores the next solution to be displayed. It is updated each time the "Next" button is clicked to display the next solution.

```{.python}
def figure_dropdown_change(change):
    global gen
    global solution
    
    if change['type'] == 'change' and change['name'] == 'value':
        value = change['new']
        next_button.layout.display = 'none'
        
        output.clear_output()
        
        gen = solve_soma(value)
        try:
            solution = next(gen)            
            with output:
                # find voxel space size
                max_dim = np.max(value) + 1

                # fill 3D voxel array and plot it
                voxels = np.empty((max_dim, max_dim, max_dim), dtype='object')
                for x, y, z, color in solution:
                    voxels[x][y][z] = color

                anim = animate_solution(voxels)
                display(HTML(anim.to_jshtml(default_mode='once')))
        except StopIteration:
            label.value = "No solutions found."
            return

        try:
            solution = next(gen).copy()
            label.value = ""
            next_button.layout.display = 'inline-block'
        except StopIteration:
            label.value = ""

figure_dropdown.observe(figure_dropdown_change)
```

The `figure_dropdown_change` function handles changes to the figure dropdown menu. It clears the output widget, displays the first solution, and stores the next solution in the solution variable (if any).

```{.python}
def on_next_button_clicked(b):
    global gen
    global solution
    
    output.clear_output(wait=True)
    with output:
        # find voxel space size
        max_dim = np.max(figure_dropdown.value) + 1

        # fill 3D voxel array and plot it
        voxels = np.empty((max_dim, max_dim, max_dim), dtype='object')
        for x, y, z, color in solution:
            voxels[x][y][z] = color

        anim = animate_solution(voxels)
        display(HTML(anim.to_jshtml(default_mode='once')))
    
    try:
        solution = next(gen)
    except StopIteration:
        label.value = ""
        next_button.layout.display = 'none'

next_button.on_click(on_next_button_clicked)

figure_dropdown_change({'type': 'change', 'name': 'value', 'new': figure_dropdown.value})
```

The `on_next_button_clicked` function handles clicks on the "Next" button by clearing the output widget, displaying the current solution, and generating the next solution.
